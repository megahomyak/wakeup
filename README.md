# THIS LIBRARY IS NOT WORKING

If you want to use something like Rust's [Waker](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/struct.Waker.html) but in Python, consider using [asyncio.Event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Event)

Since I've discovered [Event](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Event), I don't need this library anymore, so it will remain unfinished
